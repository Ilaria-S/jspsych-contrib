            <br>
            <p>The Cognitive and Decision Sciences Lab at Syracuse University invites you to participate in a research study. Following your review of this consent form, you will be asked to confirm that you are 18 years or older in order to proceed with the study. This study investigates how people learn to make decisions using a puzzle game. To better understand how people make decisions, we will use your mouse-movements on the computer screen. We will only collect mouse-movements for the duration of the experiment. We are not able to collect any mouse-movements that are not related to this experiment (e.g., in another tab). After you have reviewed this consent form, you will watch a video tutorial that explains what you will do in the experiment. You will not be able to proceed with the experiment until you have watched the tutorial at least once but you can watch it repeatedly to ensure that you fully understand what you'll do in the experimental task. After watching the tutorial, you will complete eight 12-piece puzzles, using your mouse to drag and drop the pieces. We call each drag and drop motion a move. You have an unlimited number of moves to complete the puzzle. If have difficulty solving a puzzle, you can click the [Need help?] button at the bottom of the page. You can click the [Need help?] button as many times as you need to. If you are done solving the puzzle, click on [Next puzzle] at the bottom of the page. You will not be able to proceed to the next puzzle without having solved the current puzzle. As a last step, we will ask you some questions on your experience with this study. Completing the study will take about 30 minutes of your time. </p>
            <p>Your involvement in the study is voluntary. This means you can choose whether to participate and that you may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. You will receive research credit commensurate with the time you spent participating in the study. 15 minutes of participation corresponds to 0.25 SONA credits. </p>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the research please ask them now or contact Dr. Schooler, who directs the Cognitive and Decision Sciences Lab, at lschoole@syr.edu. </p>
